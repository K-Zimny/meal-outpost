# Meal Outpost — Web3 Three.js Experience

This repository contains the source for **Meal Outpost**, an immersive Three.js web experience built for a crypto-backed food collective. The site blends interactive 3D visuals with a modern web stack to communicate brand identity, decentralization, and community-driven food systems.

Live site: https://meal-outpost.vercel.app/

## Overview

Meal Outpost is an experimental, front-end-focused project designed to showcase how Web3 concepts and digital communities can intersect with food systems. The experience prioritizes atmosphere, motion, and spatial interaction over traditional page-based navigation.

## Core Features

- Interactive 3D scene built with Three.js
- WebGL-powered animations and transitions
- Narrative-driven layout instead of standard UI patterns
- Optimized for modern browsers
- Deployed on Vercel

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js
- **3D / Graphics:** Three.js
- **Styling:** CSS / utility-based styling
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **Rendering:** WebGL

## Concept

The project explores:
- Decentralized ownership models applied to food systems
- Community-backed collectives
- Experimental digital storytelling
- Brand-first interaction design

This is not a traditional marketing site. It is a visual and conceptual experience meant to signal innovation, decentralization, and future-forward thinking.

## Development Notes

- Built with performance in mind despite heavy 3D usage
- Scene complexity balanced to maintain acceptable frame rates
- Designed primarily for desktop, with graceful degradation on lower-powered devices

## Future Enhancements

- Deeper user interaction within the 3D environment
- Audio-reactive elements
- Wallet-aware or token-gated experiences
- Expanded narrative layers tied to community actions

## Disclaimer

This project is an experimental front-end and creative build. It is intended for demonstration, branding, and exploratory purposes.
